#Installing and Using Fluxbox

Fluxbox is a lightweight Windows Manager. Fluxbox takes a minimalist approach in presenting the windows mangaer.
To install Fluxbox, we perform the following;
1. sudo apt-get install fluxbox

Once the installation is complete, reboot the computer or logout of the session.
Under options in the logon session, choose Fluxbox, which will require the user to login with a password.

The fluxbox manager can be described as a _Stack Window Manager_ that sports a taskbar and pop-up dialog menu.
This stacks up files and folders on top of each other. It is lightweight and very customizable. 
To access the menu, you have to right-click on the desktop area. 
The menu can be made to _stick_ on the desktop by left-clicking on its title bar.. 

The taskbar at the bottom of the screen shows running programs and lets workspaces be switched.
