#How to Restart Server
Hello Team CodeBlockers.
I realised the minecraft service fails after awhile, while we report tis to the ADMIN,
we should do the following to keep the service alive;
1. Login into your SootSplash account
2. cd /opt
3. cd scripts
4. screen
WHEN SCREEN LAUNCES JUST ACCEPT BY USING THE _RETURN_. 
4. sudo ./codebminecraft.sh

Once the script is launched, the server will boot up

THANKS TEAM
